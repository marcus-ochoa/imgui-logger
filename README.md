# ImGUI Logger
UCSC CMPM123 Logger Assignment

## Notes
I spent most of the time with this assignment brushing up on C / C++ programming fundamentals since it has been a minute since I have used either language. I made a singleton with a vector of log structs which were printed out. I went with this approach because that is what was recommended in the discord discussion. Although I didn't ask questions myself, I found the discussion online and in class very helpful. I plan to ask more questions myself in the future now that I am a little more brushed up on my C / C++ programming (I still feel like I don't have as good of a grasp on the fundamentals as I would like however). Making a global service like a logger a singleton makes sense for accessibility and consistency. Making log structs also makes sense. Because I most recently coded in C rather than C++ I started out not using the standard string library and ended up not using it really. I found it annoying that as far as I could tell string formatting during runtime was still a little complicated with the string library so I just ended up using snprintf which may not be ideal. Overall I still need to get a better grasp of the C++ fundamentals, but I am happy to have gotten basic functionality here.
